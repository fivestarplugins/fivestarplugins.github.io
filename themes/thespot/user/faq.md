## <a name="logo"></a> How do I add my logo?

You can upload your logo to display on your website by going to the customizer under **Appearance > Customize**. Open the **Logo** section indicated below to upload your logo.

For best performance, you shouldn't upload a logo that's too large. A logo that is 500px wide is plenty large to be displayed crisply even on retina screens.

## <a name="homepage"></a> How do I build a homepage like the demo?

The **Theme Customizer** will give you special display options to build an effective homepage. You can find the customizer by going to **Appearance > Customize**.

If you've completed the [recommended first steps](getting-started/first-steps), you will have already uploaded your logo and created your primary navigation menu.

When you reach the Theme Customizer, open the **Header Image** section:

![Screenshot indicating the Header Image section in the customizer](/img/theme/{{ page.slug }}/customizer-header-image.png)

Here you can upload a full-width image to display prominently on your homepage. Your image should be very large, at least 2000 pixels wide, to account for visitors who will view your website on large screens.

You'll have an opportunity to crop the image to 2000x1333 pixels in size.

Next, in the Theme Customizer, open the **Call to Action** section:

![Screenshot indicating the Call to action section in the customizer](/img/theme/{{ page.slug }}/customizer-call-to-action.png)

This section allows you to set the text for the call to action on your homepage. This is a big, attention-grabbing statement that should get visitors excited about your restaurant, cafe or bar.

Aside from the header image, this could be the most important text on your site, so spend some time getting it *just right*.

You can also set the text for the button which appears below the call to action, and then choose any Page on your site to send visitors to in the **Button Target** option.

If you take online bookings, I recommend setting the **Button Target** to your reservations page. Otherwise, you can send them to your opening hours, contact details or online menu.

Next, in the Theme Customizer, open the **Display Options** section:

![Screenshot indicating the Display Options section in the customizer](/img/theme/{{ page.slug }}/customizer-display-options.png)

This section allows you to control the sidebar behavior and configure your footer panels.

The **Sidebar** option allows you to hide the sidebar on every page of your site. If you don't have anything you want to display there, select this option to turn every one of your pages and posts into a full-width page.

You'll also find a series of options for your **Footer Panels**. These panels sit at the bottom of your site and provide a flexible way to display different content you want to be avaiable on every site.

On the homepage, clicking on any of these panels will cause it to slide open, revealing the content you've configured.

On any other page, these panels will appear below the main content, and the first panel will be open.

If you've enabled all of the recommended plugins, each panel can have one of the following options:

- **Nothing**: Select this option if you don't want the panel to appear. This is useful if you only have two or three panels to display.
- **Map**: Show a map to your location. (You must have filled out your [Business Profile](getting-started/first-steps#set-up-your-business-profile))
- **Contact Card**: Show your address, phone number, opening hours and a map to your location. (You must have filled out your [Business Profile](getting-started/first-steps#set-up-your-business-profile))
- **Random Review**: Show one of your reviews selected randomly each time the page loads. (Requires the [Good Reviews](plugins#good-reviews-wp)) plugin.
- **Custom Widget Area**: Add a widget area you can fill with whatever widgets you'd like. Once you've selected this option, you'll need to save your changes then reload the customizer. Once reloaded, you should see the new widget areas appear under the Widgets section in the customizer.

And that's all you need to do to set up a great homepage for your restaurant, cafe or bar. If you really want to shine, here are a couple more recommendations.

First, get a great photo. If you haven't hired a professional to take a photo of your place, you might consider investing in that. Since the photo is so prominent in this homepage design, it can have a huge impact on how successful your homepage is.

Second, after you've uploaded the header, you might find the call to action is a little bit hard to read. Under **Header Image > Header Darkness** you can use the slider to make the background image darker. It's really important that your call to action is clear and easy-to-read against the background image.

Finally, keep your menus short. You can nest menu items beneath each other if you have more than 4 or 5. Keeping the list short will help visitors who are scanning quickly. I've written about [good navigation menu design for restaurants](https://www.fivestarplugins.com/2016/04/19/build-good-navigation-menu-restaurants/) if you want to learn more.

## <a name="photo-gallery"></a> How can I create a photo gallery that opens in a lightbox like the demo?

WordPress supports great photo galleries right out of the box and this theme displays them beautifully. I like them so much that I wrote a [step-by-step guide on how to add photo galleries](https://www.fivestarplugins.com/2015/12/08/creating-photo-galleries-the-wordpress-way/) to your pages and posts.

When you're following the guide to create a gallery, make sure that you set the **Link to** option to "Media File". This theme will automatically display such photos in a lightbox when they're clicked.
