## <a name="logo"></a> How do I add my logo?

You can upload your logo to display on your website by going to the customizer under **Appearance > Customize**. Open the **Logo, Site Title and Tagline** section and click the button to upload your image file.

Once uploaded, you can use the **Scale** slider to increase or decrease the size.

## <a name="footer-address"></a> How do I add my address to the bottom of my site?

Once you have filled out your **Business Profile**, your contact details will automatically appear at the bottom of your site, just like the demo.

You can learn more about how to fill out your business profile in the section on [recommended first steps](/{{ site.data[page.slug].base}}/user/getting-started/first-steps). If you haven't yet, be sure to take a look.

## <a name="homepage"></a> How do I build a homepage like the demo?

Luigi comes with a powerful tool to construct a gorgeous, effective landing page. Before you can use it, though, you'll need to have configured a Static Home Page. If you haven't done so, read the [recommended first steps](/{{ site.data[page.slug].base}}/user/getting-started/first-steps).

Once you've got your homepage set up, open the customizer from the **Appearance > Customize** link (you may already have the customizer open). When you're looking at the homepage in the customizer, you'll see a **Homepage Layout** section. Open that to begin working with the layout builder.

To add a component, follow these steps:

1. Click the **Add Component** button to open the list of available components. *If you are missing some of the [recommended plugins](/{{ site.data[page.slug].base}}/user/getting-started/activate-plugins), you may be missing some components.*

2. Select a component from the list. Try the **Hero Block** first.

3. Click the small dropdown arrow in the newly added component to open the input form.<br>

4. Fill out the details in the component's form as desired and watch the view on the right update as you go.

5. You can repeat these steps adding as many different components as you'd like. When you're happy with how it looks, click the **Save & Publish** button at the top of the screen to publish your changes to the live site.
