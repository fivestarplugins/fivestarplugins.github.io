In order to fully utilize all the features of this theme, and to make the best restaurant website possible, we recommend installing the following plugins:

{% include theme/user/plugins/restaurant-reservations.md %}
{% include theme/user/plugins/food-and-drink-menu.md %}
{% include theme/user/plugins/business-profile.md %}
{% include theme/user/plugins/ultimate-faq.md %}

## Activate Plugins

After activating the theme, you will see a new item in the WordPress **Appearance** menu called **Restaurant Block Theme**. Click this to open the Restaurant Block Theme admin dashboard. Here you will find a **Recommended Plugins** section. All you have to do is click the button for each plugin you require and it will automatically install the plugin directly from the WordPress respository.
