title: WordPress Community Translation Portal
---
The preferred way for translating plugins and themes is now to use the WordPress community translation portal. We recommend that you contribute this way instead of creating your translation via a program like Poedit. Not only will you ensure that your translation works correctly and will continue to work in the future, but you will be helping to provide a translation for any other users who might speak the same language as you. 

You can find the portal for this theme here: [https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-themes/restaurant-block/](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-themes/restaurant-block/)
