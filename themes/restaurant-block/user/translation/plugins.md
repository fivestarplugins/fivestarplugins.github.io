All of the static labels/strings that appear on the front end of this plugin are localized in the code. This means they are ready to be translated and can be found and identified as such by any translation plugins (e.g. WPML, Polylang, etc.). 

*More info on WordPress localization/internationalization can be found [here](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/internationalization/).*

We've included an up-to-date .pot file in the **languages** folder. This means that any popular language plugin should easily be able to identify the localized strings and let you translate them. 

It also means that you could use a program like [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) to create your own translation and generate .mo and .po files for it. However, WordPress's community translation portal is now the preferred way (and how we recommend) to translate plugins and themes. For more info on that, please see [here](community).
