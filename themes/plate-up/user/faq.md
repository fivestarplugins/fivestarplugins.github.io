## <a name="logo"></a> How do I add my logo?

You can upload your logo to display on your website by going to the customizer under **Appearance > Customize**. Open the **Logo** section indicated below to upload your logo.

For best performance, you shouldn't upload a logo that's too large. A logo that is 500px wide is plenty large to be displayed crisply even on retina screens.

## <a name="homepage"></a> How do I build a homepage like the demo?

The **Theme Customizer** will give you special display options to build an effective homepage. You can find the customizer by going to **Appearance > Customize**.

If you've completed the [recommended first steps](getting-started/first-steps), you will have already uploaded your logo and created your primary navigation menu.

When you reach the Theme Customizer, open the **Header Image** section:

![Screenshot indicating the Header Image section in the customizer](/img/theme/{{ page.slug }}/customizer-header-image.png)

Here you can upload a full-width image to display prominently on your homepage. Your image should be very large, at least 2000 pixels wide, to account for visitors who will view your website on large screens.

You'll have an opportunity to crop the image to 2000x1000 pixels in size.

Next, in the Theme Customizer, open the **Display Options** section:

![Screenshot indicating the Display Options section in the customizer](/img/theme/{{ page.slug }}/customizer-display-options.png)

This section provides you with three options:

- The **Header Tagline** lets you choose what to display at the top right of your website, above the primary navigation menu. If you're taking online reservations, I recommend selecting the "Booking page" option.
- The **Front Page Review** option lets you display one of your reviews over the header image. Select "All Reviews" if you want to cycle between your reviews.
- The **Google Map** option lets you decide how you want to display the map near the bottom of your site. The demo shows it on every page, but you may want to limit it to just some pages.

The rest of the homepage content is taken from the Page you've selected for the Static Front Page (see the [recommended first steps](getting-started/first-steps) if you don't remember).

The title and content of this page are displayed, alongside a special widget area named **Homepage Sidebar**.

To add a widget to this area, open the **Widgets** section in the Theme Customizer:

![Screenshot indicating the Widgets section in the customizer](/img/theme/{{ page.slug }}/customizer-widgets.png)

From there, open the **Homepage Sidebar** section. You can then add any widget you'd like.

If you're taking online reservations, I recommend adding the **Booking Form** widget. If not, you might want to add the **Contact Card** widget with your opening hours.

## <a name="footer-address"></a> How do I add contact details to my site?

Once you have filled out your [Business Profile](plugins#business-profile), you can display these details in any widget area using the **Contact Card** widget.

This theme comes with a sidebar widget area which appears on most pages, and three footer widget areas which appear on every page.

I recommend using the footer widget areas. Visitors to your website will commonly look for contact details at the bottom of your site. You can use multiple widgets to separate the details like this.

## <a name="photo-gallery"></a> How can I create a photo gallery that opens in a lightbox like the demo?

WordPress supports great photo galleries right out of the box and this theme displays them beautifully. I like them so much that I wrote a [step-by-step guide on how to add photo galleries](https://www.fivestarplugins.com/2015/12/08/creating-photo-galleries-the-wordpress-way/) to your pages and posts.

When you're following the guide to create a gallery, make sure that you set the **Link to** option to "Media File". This theme will automatically display such photos in a lightbox when they're clicked.
