## <a name="more-help"></a> I'm in over my head. Where can I get more hands-on help?

We do our best to help every customer use any of our products. But you may need more dedicated help than We're able to provide.

If you need **a helping hand** when building your restaurant, cafe or bar website, take a look at [WP Site Care](http://www.wpsitecare.com/). They provide on-going support and maintenance, including advice when you're having trouble, audits to improve your website performance and SEO, and more.

If you need **custom code development** to add a feature or make more significant alterations to your site, take a look at [codeable.io](https://codeable.io/). They match your needs with qualified freelance developers who can take on small and large customization projects.

We do not receive any compensation for recommending either of these services.
