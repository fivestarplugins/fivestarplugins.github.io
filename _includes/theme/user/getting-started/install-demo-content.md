You can generate demo content for the most common plugins to help you quickly orient yourself to your new restaurant website.

To do this:

1. Go to the **Appearance > Theme Setup** page in your WordPress admin area.
2. Under the **Demo Content** section, you'll see each plugin listed for which you can generate demo content. You may need to install and activate the plugin before installing demo content.
3. Once the plugin has been installed and activated, click the **Install Demo Content** button next to each plugin.
4. After the demo content has been generated, click the **View Demo** link to jump to the demo content.

Each plugin's demo generates a **Page** in your WordPress site that you can view. To find where the data has been stored, you'll want to consult the documentation for each of the [recommended plugins](/{{ site.data[page.slug].base}}/user/plugins).
