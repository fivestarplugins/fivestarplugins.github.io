## <a name="reviews"></a> How do I add reviews of my restaurant?

This theme integrates with the free [Good Reviews for WordPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/good-reviews-wp/) plugin.

Once the plugin is [installed and activated](/{{ site.data[page.slug].base}}/user/getting-started/activate-plugins), go to the **Reviews** page in your WordPress admin area. From here you can add and edit reviews.

Learn more by visiting the [plugin's documentation](/plugins/good-reviews-wp).
