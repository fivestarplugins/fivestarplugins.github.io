## <a name="seo"></a> How do I improve my restaurant's SEO?

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a large and complex topic. But it is extraordinarily valuable for restaurants, cafes and bars.

If you haven't already, I recommend you install the [Yoast SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) plugin, which gives you a number of useful tools to help you optimize your site.

Yoast has [written the book](https://yoast.com/wordpress-seo/) on Search Engine Optimization with WordPress. But learning how to make effective use of it can take time, and it may feel overwhelming if you've never encountered it before.

I've written a few guides that break down those aspects of SEO that I believe are most critical to restaurants:

- [Three fast steps to improve your restaurant SEO with Yoast](https://www.fivestarplugins.com/2015/02/17/three-fast-steps-improve-restaurant-seo-yoast/)
- [Tending your SEO garden with Google's Search Console](https://www.fivestarplugins.com/2015/08/31/tending-your-seo-garden-with-googles-search-console/)
- [But I'm big in Japan: local search for your restaurant website](https://www.fivestarplugins.com/2015/03/18/but-im-big-in-japan-local-search-for-your-restaurant-website/)
