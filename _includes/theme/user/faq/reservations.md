## <a name="reservations"></a> How do I take reservations for my restaurant?

This theme integrates with the free [Restaurant Reservations](http://wordpress.org/plugins/restaurant-reservations/) plugin.

Once the plugin is [installed and activated](/{{ site.data[page.slug].base}}/user/getting-started/activate-plugins), create a new page for your booking form. Then go to the **Bookings > Settings** page and select your **Booking Page**. The reservations form will automatically appear on this page.

You can also add the form to any page or post with the `[booking-form]` shortcode, or use the **Booking Form** widget to add it to a sidebar.

There's *so much more* you can do, from setting your booking schedule to configuring notifications. There are also *powerful addons* to [add custom fields](https://www.fivestarplugins.com/plugins/five-star-restaurant-reservations/custom-fields/), [build your mailing list](https://www.fivestarplugins.com/plugins/five-star-restaurant-reservations/mailchimp/) and [export bookings](https://www.fivestarplugins.com/plugins/five-star-restaurant-reservations/export-bookings/) to PDF/Excel files.

Be sure to read the [plugin's documentation](/plugins/restaurant-reservations).
