## <a name="typecase"></a> How can I change the fonts?

This theme integrates with the [Typecase](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typecase/) plugin to make it easy to change the font(s) used on your website.

Once you've installed and activated the plugin, you'll need to select new fonts to display on your site by going to the **Typecase** page in your admin area.

Search for the Google Webfont you want to use and add it to your collection.

*Don't worry about assigning any "selectors". That will be done automatically by the theme.*

Once you've selected your fonts, go to the **Appearance > Customize** page and open the **Theme Fonts** section. There you'll be able to assign the fonts you've selected to any fonts defined by the theme.
