## <a name="events"></a> How do I promote my restaurant's events?

This theme integrates with the free [Event Organiser](http://wordpress.org/plugins/event-organiser/) plugin.

Once the plugin is [installed and activated](/{{ site.data[page.slug].base}}/user/getting-started/activate-plugins), go to the **Events** page in your WordPress admin area. From here you can add and edit events.

Then add the `[eo_fullcalendar]` shortcode to any page or post. I recommend you use a page with the [full-width page template](#full-width-page-template).

This plugin provides [extensive documentation](http://docs.wp-event-organiser.com/) as well as a [pro version](http://wp-event-organiser.com/) with more features.
