## <a name="social-profile-menu"></a> How do I add icons which link to my social media profiles?

This theme is configured to support a special navigation menu for your social media profiles.

To set this up, go to the **Appearance > Menus** page in your WordPress admin area. Create a navigation menu using the **Custom Links** type of menu component. Enter the link to your social media profile.

Once you've saved the links to your social media profiles, assign this menu to the **Social Profiles** theme location.

Assigned to this theme location, the theme will automatically transform the menu into a set of icons matching your social media profiles.
