## <a name="business-profile"></a> How do I display my restaurant's contact details?

This theme integrates with the free [Business Profile](http://wordpress.org/plugins/business-profile/) plugin.

Once the plugin is [installed and activated](/{{ site.data[page.slug].base}}/user/getting-started/activate-plugins), open the **Business Profile** page in your WordPress admin area (*hint: it's way down near the bottom of the navigation menu on the left*). Fill out your restaurant's details.

Then just add the `[contact-card]` to any page or post, or use the **Contact Card** widget to display it in any sidebar.

Learn more by visiting the [plugin's documentation](/plugins/business-profile).
