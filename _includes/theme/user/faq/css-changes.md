## <a name="css-changes"></a> Can I make changes to the CSS styles?

There are several ways you can add your own CSS code. But the **worst way** is to edit the theme files directly. Any changes you make to the theme's files will get overwritten the next time the theme is updated.

I recommend you use the CSS feature that's part of WordPress itself. To use it, go to the **Appearance > Customize** page and open the **Additional CSS** section. You can enter your CSS in there and see it applied immediately in the live preview.

If you plan to use a lot of CSS and you want to be able to save the file locally, I'd recommend you use a **Child Theme**. Along with the download link for the theme in your purchase receipt, you also received a download link for an empty child theme. When making changes to the theme, I strongly urge you to activate the child theme instead of the base theme. You can add CSS styles to the `style.css` file and they'll automatically get loaded.
