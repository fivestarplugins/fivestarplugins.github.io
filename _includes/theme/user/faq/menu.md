## <a name="menu"></a> How do I build my restaurant's menu?

This theme integrates with the free [Food and Drink Menu](https://wordpress.org/plugins/food-and-drink-menu/) plugin.

Once the plugin is [installed and activated](/{{ site.data[page.slug].base}}/user/getting-started/activate-plugins), you can begin building your menus by going to the **Menu Items** page in your WordPress admin area.

Learn more by visiting the [plugin's documentation](/plugins/food-and-drink-menu) and don't miss the [Pro version](https://www.fivestarplugins.com/plugin/five-star-restaurant-menu/).
