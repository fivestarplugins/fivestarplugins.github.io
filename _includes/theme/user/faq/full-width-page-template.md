## <a name="full-width-page-template"></a> Can I hide the sidebar on just one page?

This theme includes a full-width page template. It's great for pages where you want to focus on one piece of content -- like a photo gallery or your booking form.

To make use of this template, go to the **Pages > Add New** page in your WordPress admin area. On the page editing screen, find the **Page Attributes** box on the right, below the publish button.

Set the **Template** option to *Full Width* then preview the page and you'll see the sidebar is gone.
