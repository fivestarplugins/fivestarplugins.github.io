## <a name="photo-gallery"></a> How can I create a photo gallery that opens in a lightbox like the demo?

WordPress supports great photo galleries right out of the box and this theme displays them beautifully. I like them so much that I wrote a [step-by-step guide on how to add photo galleries](https://www.fivestarplugins.com/2015/12/08/creating-photo-galleries-the-wordpress-way/) to your pages and posts.

This theme integrates with the free [WP Featherlight](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-featherlight/) plugin. When [installed and activated](/{{ site.data[page.slug].base}}/user/getting-started/activate-plugins), it will open your images in a lightbox for dramatic effect.
