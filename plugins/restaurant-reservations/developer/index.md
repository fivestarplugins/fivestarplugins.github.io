Five Star Restaurant Reservations comes with several filters and hooks to make it more extensible for developers.

## Filters

These are the available filters. You could, for example, use these in your theme's functions.php file to extend the functionality of the plugin.

- `rtb_party_size_upper_limit` => Set the upper limit for the party size dropdown box on the settings page
- `rtb-max-reservations-upper-limit` => Set the upper limit for the maximum reservations dropdown box on the settings page (default 100)
- `rtb-max-people-upper-limit` => Set the upper limit for the maximum people dropdown box on the settings page (default 100)
- `rtb-auto-confirm-reservations-upper-limit` => Set the upper limit for the auto-confirm reservations dropdown box on the settings page (default 100)
- `rtb-auto-confirm-seats-upper-limit` => Set the upper limit for the autoiconfirm seats dropdown box on the settings page (default 400)
- `rtb_booking_submit_success_redirect` => Manipulate the redirect after a successful booking. For example, you could use a different redirect URL for different times of the day. It receives three parameters and returns a URL. [Example](https://gist.github.com/fivestarplugins/9ad9de6c844076f00aedbe98a870bd16).
