title: Five Star Restaurant Reservations User Guide
---
This user guide is for anyone ho wants to learn how to [install the plugin](getting-started/install), [configure the bookings options](config), [manage bookings](manage), or use one of the commercial addons.

There's a [FAQ](faq) that answers many of the most common questions. And a [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/restaurant-reservations) for the free plugin.

If you need help with any of the commercial addons, please use the [contact form](https://www.fivestarplugins.com/support-center/) on my website.
