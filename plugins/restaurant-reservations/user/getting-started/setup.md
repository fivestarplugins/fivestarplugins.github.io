All you need to get started taking bookings is add the booking form to your website. There are four ways you can do this.

1. Add the **Booking Form** block to any page or post.

2. Automatically add the booking form to any page on your website. Go to the **Bookings > Settings** page in your admin dashboard. Select one of your pages in the dropdown list for **Booking Page**. The booking form will automatically be added to that page.

3. Add the Booking Form widget to any sidebar. Go to **Appearance > Widgets** and find the Booking Form widget. Add it to any sidebar to display your booking form there.

4. Use the `[booking-form]` shortcode to add your booking form to any page or post on your website. Simply copy and paste `[booking-form]` into the content of any page or post.

Once the form is appearing on your site, you're ready to go!

You can move on to start [managing your bookings](../manage) or learn more about [configuring your booking schedule, customizing email notifications, and more](../config).
