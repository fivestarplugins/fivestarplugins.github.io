### Scroll To Top

Should the browser scroll to the top of the FAQ when it's opened?

### Turn On Comment Support

Should comment support be turned on, so that, if the "Allow Comments" checkbox is selected for a given FAQ, comments are shown in the FAQ list?

By default, the plugin adds FAQ Page schema when the shortcode or block is used. Select this option to disable this behaviour.

Should the FAQs open on a separate page when clicked, instead of toggling open and closed?
