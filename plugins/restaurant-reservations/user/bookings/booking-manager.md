title: Setting up a Booking Manager
---
Five Star Restaurant Reservations creates a new User Role in your WordPress website called a Booking Manager. This role has only one permission: to add, edit, confirm and reject your bookings.

This role is great for when you'd like to allow staff to manage the bookings but don't want them to be able to touch any other parts of your website. It's also great if you keep a smart phone or tablet in your restaurant to quickly manage bookings.

To use this, go to **User > Add New** and make sure you select **Booking Manager** when assigning a Role.

*If you're a developer, this role has one capability, `manage_bookings`, which you can assign to any user if you'd like. See all of the [developer documentation](../../developer).*
