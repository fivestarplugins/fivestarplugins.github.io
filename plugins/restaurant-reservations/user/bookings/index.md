Go to the **Bookings** page in your WordPress admin area to find all of your bookings. In the screenshot below, there's one pending booking coming up.

*When you first arrive on the page it will only show you upcoming bookings. But you can [view other bookings too](find-bookings)!*

## View a message left during booking

If the customer has left a message when making their booking, you'll find that under the Details column on the right.

*If you're using [custom fields](../custom-fields), you'll find your custom fields here too.*

The first thing you'll probably want to do, though, is [create your booking schedule](schedule) and [add your booking form to a page](add-booking-form-to-page).
