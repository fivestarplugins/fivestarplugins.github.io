Here we explain how you can easily confirm and reject bookings, and how you can modify the details of a booking.

## Confirm and Reject Bookings

To confirm or reject a booking, tick the checkbox to the left of a booking. Select the action you'd like to take and then click the **Apply** button. In this image, we're about to confirm a booking.

If you have several pending bookings, you can confirm them all at once by ticking the checkboxes beside multiple bookings before clicking the **Apply** button.

## Confirm or reject a booking without sending an email notification

By default, when you confirm or reject a booking, an email will be sent to the customer informing them. If you'd like to confirm or reject a booking without sending out an email notification, you can do this through the edit booking popup.

Change the booking status to whatever you'd like, make sure the checkbox next to *Send Notifications* is **not** checked, and then edit the booking.

This is useful in situations where you may need to make changes to a booking after speaking to a customer directly.

## Confirm or reject a booking directly from an email notification

If you've enabled the Admin Notification Email in the [settings](../config/email-notifications), you can include a quick link to confirm or reject a booking straight from the email.

In order for this to work, you'll need to be logged into your WordPress website. Keeping a tablet or mobile phone in your restaurant that's logged in is a great way to quickly manage incoming booking requests.

## Edit the details of a booking

You can edit each booking by moving your mouse over the booking in the list and clicking the **Edit** link.

This is useful in cases where a customer might phone in with a change to their booking.

*When you edit a booking in this way, no notifications are sent to the customer by default. Check the __Send Notifications__ box if you want to send notifications out.*

## Five Star Restaurant Manager Mobile App

You can also manage your bookings directly in the [Five Star Restaurant Manage Mobile App](../fsrm). This way you can have your host view upcoming bookings and check guests in from a tablet front of house, all without having to log in to WordPress. And you can manage bookings on the go from your phone!
