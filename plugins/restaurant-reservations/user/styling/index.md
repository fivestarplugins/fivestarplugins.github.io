The premium version of this plugin comes with many styling options, which can be accessed by navigating to **Settings > Styling**.

For info on adding/using custom CSS, please see [here](css).

## TOGGLE SYMBOL

The section lets you adjust the styling of the toggle symbol.

Use the **Toggle Symbol** setting to choose which icons you want to display when an FAQ is closed and open. We created these using a font, which allows you to make them any color you want, using the **Toggle Color** setting, and which also allows you to make them any size you want, using the **Toggle Font Size** setting, without any loss of quality.

The rest of this section consists of settings that let you change the other colors and border properties of the toggle symbol.

## THEMES

This section includes settings that let you change the colors, font family, font sizes, padding and margins of the various theme elements (i.e. if you're using one of the block [FAQ display styles](../settings/premium#faq-display-style)).

## FAQ ELEMENTS

This section includes settings that let you change the colors, font family, margin and padding for the different elements found in each FAQ (which are: the title/question, the answer, the categories and tags, and the date).

## HEADINGS

The **Category Heading Type** and **FAQ Heading Type** settings let you specify which HTML heading tag you would like to use for each. This is useful if your theme applies specific styling to each heading and you want to take advantage of this. It's also useful to know which heading type is being used if you would like to add [custom CSS](css) for it.

The remaining settings allow you to set the color, font family and font size for the category heading.
