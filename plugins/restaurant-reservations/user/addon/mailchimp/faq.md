*The following frequently asked questions only cover the [MailChimp](../mailchimp) addon.*

## I can't connect the email address to my MailChimp merge field

The email field is merged automatically. You don't need to configure anything.

## The opt-in prompt does not appear on my booking form

Some themes have overwritten the booking form used by [Restaurant Reservations](http://wordpress.org/plugins/restaurant-reservations). Unfortunately, in doing so they have broken compatibility with my addons.

Known themes that are problematic include the Nuvo and Aqua themes. Though others have cropped up from time to time.
