## Activate your license key

Once you've installed and activated the plugin, you should activate your license, which entitles you to *support and updates* for one year.

Go to the **Bookings > MailChimp License** page in your WordPress admin area. Enter the License Key which was provided in your purchase receipt and click the **Save Changes** button. When the page reloads, you'll see a button to **Activate License**.

If you're adding this to a development site, remember to deactivate the license before moving the site to a live URL, then reactivate it on the live site.
