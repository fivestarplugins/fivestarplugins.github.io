If you are using the payment/deposit feature of the [ultimate version](../premium/ultimate-benefits), the plugin comes with the ability for you to add your own custom payment gateway. 

*Please note that this is an **advanced feature** that requires some knowledge of coding and is not something we can normally assist with or offer support for, as we are likely not familiar with the gateway/API you would like to use/implement.*

To add a custom gateway, you need to add/create a new plugin. We have built a sample plugin, which you can use as a template.

You'll find commented notes in the plugin files that provide instructions on how you can modify it to be used for your gateway.
