The name of the Gutenberg block is **Booking Form**. It can be found in its own category/section called **Five Star Restaurant Reservations**. Alternatively, when you add a new block, you can just search for **booking form** and add the block to the page.

<!-- ![Gif of adding the Display FAQs block](/img/{{ page.slug }}/ufaq-display-faqs-block.gif) -->

After adding the block, you will see a preview of the booking form in the page edit area.
