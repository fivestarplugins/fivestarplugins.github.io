The name of the Gutenberg block is **Booking Form**. It can be found in its own category/section called **Five Star Restaurant Reservations**. Alternatively, when you add a new block, you can just search for **booking form** and add the block to the page.

After adding the block, you will see a preview of the booking form in the page edit area.

If you have [multiple locations](../multiple-locations) enabled, you will also see an option in the right sidebar to choose a specific location for the booking form, which will remove the option for the customer to select the location and automatically assign the booking to that location.
