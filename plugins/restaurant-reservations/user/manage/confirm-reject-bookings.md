To confirm or reject a booking, tick the checkbox to the left of a booking. Select the action you'd like to take and then click the **Apply** button. In this image, we're about to confirm a booking.

If you have several pending bookings, you can confirm them all at once by ticking the checkboxes beside multiple bookings before clicking the **Apply** button.

## Confirm or reject a booking without sending an email notification

By default, when you confirm or reject a booking, an email will be sent to the customer informing them. If you'd like to confirm or reject a booking without sending out an email notification, you can do this through the edit booking popup.

Change the booking status to whatever you'd like, make sure the checkbox next to *Send Notifications* is **not** checked, and then edit the booking.

This is useful in situations where you may need to make changes to a booking after speaking to a customer directly.

## Confirm or reject a booking directly from an email notification

If you've enabled the Admin Notification Email in the [settings](../config/email-notifications), you can include a quick link to confirm or reject a booking straight from the email.

In order for this to work, you'll need to be logged into your WordPress website. Keeping a tablet or mobile phone in your restaurant that's logged in is a great way to quickly manage incoming booking requests.
