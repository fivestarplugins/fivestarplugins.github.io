Go to the **Bookings** page in your WordPress admin area to find all of your bookings. In the screenshot below, there's one pending booking coming up.

*When you first arrive on the page it will only show you upcoming bookings. But you can [view other bookings too](find-bookings)!*

## View a message left during booking

If the customer has left a message when making their booking, you'll find that under the Details column on the right.

*When you're using the [Custom Fields addon](../addon/custom-fields), you'll find your custom fields here too.*

## Edit the details of a booking

You can edit each booking by moving your mouse over the booking in the list and clicking the **Edit** link.

This is useful in cases where a customer might phone in with a change to their booking.

*When you edit a booking in this way, no notifications are sent to the customer by default. Check the __Send Notifications__ box if you want to send notifications out.*

The first thing you'll probably want to do, though, is [confirm or reject a booking](confirm-reject-bookings).
