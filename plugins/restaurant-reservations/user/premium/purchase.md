Purchasing and activating the premium or ultimate versions is easy and only takes a few minutes. You can reach the purchase page directly from the plugin dashboard by clicking the "Upgrade Now" button.

Alternatively, you can [visit our website](https://www.fivestarplugins.com/) and click on the Five Star Restaurant Reservations plugin, or go directly to [https://www.fivestarplugins.com/plugins/five-star-restaurant-reservations/](https://www.fivestarplugins.com/plugins/five-star-restaurant-reservations/), and then click on **Purchase Now** or **Get Ultimate**.

## Premium License Options

There are three license options for the premium version. A single-site license, a five-site license and a ten-site license. All three give you the exact same access to the full premium version, including all features, and all three are lifetime licenses. The only difference is the number of product keys that you get.

For developers or those that need to run the plugin on multiple sites, we offer the five- and ten-site licenses. You can see that these are heavily discounted when compared to the single-site license. Keep that in mind when making your decision. If you think that, at any point, you will need to activate the plugin on more than one site, it might make more sense to buy one of the multi-site licenses, to save money.

## Premium Support Subscription

Six months of premium support are included with each premium license purchase. If you would like access to support beyond the initial six months, then make sure you have the support subscription option checked when you purchase the plugin. 

The subscription is billed at $29 every six months.

If you do not require access to support beyond the included six months, then just make sure to have the support subscription option unchecked when you purchase and it will be just the one-time purchase for the lifetime premium license.

It is clearly indicated in the cart whether or not you have currently selected the support subscription option.

## Ultimate License

The ultimate license has only one purchase option, which is a single site. Due to the nature of the associated SMS account and credits, multi-site licenses are not possible with the ultimate version.

Also, the ultimate purchase is not a lifetime license. It is available as either a monthly or an annual subscription. This is required due to ongoing costs, such as the SMS credits. If you cancel your ultimate plan subscription, you will lose access to the ultimate version at the end of the current subscription term.

Premium support is included with each ultimate license. There is no further subscription or payment necessary for this.

## Receiving Your Product Key(s)

Your product key(s) will be automatically sent to you after you complete the purchase. 

If you *paid via PayPal*, then the key will be sent to the email address associated with your PayPal account. So please make sure this is correct and up to date.

If you *paid directly via credit card*, then the key will be sent to the email address that you provided at the time of checkout. So please make sure to enter it carefully and correctly.

Once you receive your key, you can now [activate the premium version](activate).
