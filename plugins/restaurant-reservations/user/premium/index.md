The premium version extends the capabilities of the Five Star [Restaurant Reservations WordPress plugin](https://www.fivestarplugins.com/plugins/five-star-restaurant-reservations) with the ability to limit the number of people or reservations at one time, as well as with layout and styling options, custom fields for your booking form, and much more.

The ultimate version contains several powerful features to give you and your guests an amazing booking experience and also to help you reduce the amount of no-shows at your restaurant, including SMS reminders, table selection, payment deposits and access to the [Five Star Restaurant Manager mobile app](../fsrm).
