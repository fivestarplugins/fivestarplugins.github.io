To activate the premium version of the plugin, you need to download the **Etoile Web Design Premium Premium Helper** plugin. You can do so by clicking the **Visit our website** link in the plugin dashboard.

Alternatively, you can download it directly [here](https://etoilewebdesign.com/downloads/ewd-premium-helper.zip).

To install the helper plugin:

1. Go to the **Plugins** page in your WordPress admin area.
2. Click the **Add New** link at the top of the page, and then the **Upload Plugin** button on the next page.
3. Locate the plugin on your computer and select it.
4. Click **Install Now** and then activate the plugin.

Once the helper plugin is installed and activated, return to the {{ page.plugin_title }} dashboard where you will now see a field in which you can enter the product key you received.

Enter your key there and click the **Unlock Premium** button. This will instantly activate the premium version and give you access to all the features.

If you happen to get a message saying the key was invalid, try entering it again, making sure to type it in manually, as, sometimes, copy/pasting it can bring in extra spaces, etc.
