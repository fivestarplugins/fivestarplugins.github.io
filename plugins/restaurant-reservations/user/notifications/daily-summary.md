Five Star Restaurant Reservations comes with an option to send a daily summary email that shows all of the bookings for today. You can set the email address it should be sent to and the time it should be sent at by going to **Settings > Notifications**.

The time is based on your WordPress timezone setting. The email sends on the first page load on your site after the chosen time, so it is possible that it will send a bit after the chosen time.

## Troubleshooting

If you find that you are not getting the email at all, it could be because your emails are being flagged as spam/automated/coming from a bot. To help with this, we suggest using a plugin like [Ultimate WP Mail](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-wp-mail/) to send the emails via your real email address/server.
