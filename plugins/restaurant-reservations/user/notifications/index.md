With the Five Star [Restaurant Reservations WordPress plugin](https://www.fivestarplugins.com/plugins/five-star-restaurant-reservations/), when a guest makes a booking, a notification email will be automatically sent to them, as well as to the admin, depending on the chosen options.

There are also further notifications for pending, confirmed and cancelled bookings.

The ultimate version extends the notification functionality with reservation reminders, late arrival notifcations and post-reservation follow-up messages that can be sent either via SMS or email.

In this section, we cover the different notification options and settings. For an explanation of all availble notification settings, please see the following video:
