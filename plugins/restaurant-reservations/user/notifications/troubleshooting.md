### Emails not being sent/received

If you find that you are not getting emails at all, it could be because they are being flagged as spam/automated/coming from a bot. To help with this, we suggest using a plugin like [Ultimate WP Mail](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-wp-mail/) to send the emails via your real email address/server.

The Ultimate WP Mail plugin also keeps logs of all emails sent from your WordPress installation. These are valuable to check if the emails are being sent at all. If not, you likely have a configuration issue in the plugin. If they are being sent, but not received, then it is likely related to the issue mentioned in the first paragraph above.
