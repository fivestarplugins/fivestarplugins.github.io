Five Star Restaurant Reservations sends email notifications when a booking is made, rejected or confirmed. On the **Bookings > Settings > Notifications** page you can customize the content of these emails to fit your brand.

If you have [admin notifications enabled](settings), you can udpate the content of the emails sent to the admin for pending, automatically-confirmed and customer-cancelled bookings.

When a booking is made, the customer is sent an email to let them know the request has been received. Depending on how you have configured any of the options to automatically confirm bookings, the customer will either receive a message that their booking is pending, *but has not yet been accepted*, or a message letting them know their booking has been confirmed. You can edit the content of these emails here on the **Settings > Notifications** page.

There are also options here to modify the content of emails sent to the customer when a booking is rejected or cancelled.
