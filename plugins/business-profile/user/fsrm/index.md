To generate your API key, you need to log in to your WordPress admin panel and go to the Settings page for the plugin. There you will see an API section where you can generate a new key.

This is the key you can input on the Account screen in the app. Donâ€™t forget to also input your site URL. After you click save, it will automatically link the app to your site. You only have to do this once, after which it will remain connected. From then on, you no longer need to log in to your WordPress site to manage your bookings!

## How to Use

If you're using the Premium version of the plugin, you can use the app to view and update your contact card information.

For this, you just need to go to the Business Profile page in the app. Here you will find both the contact information and any scheduling that you have configured in the plugin.
