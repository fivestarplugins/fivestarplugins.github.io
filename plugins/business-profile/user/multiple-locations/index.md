Support for multiple locations was added in version 1.1. To make use of this feature, you should enable the locations from the option at the bottom of your Business Profile.

Once activated, you'll see a new **Locations** page appear in your WordPress admin area, where you can add and edit locations.

When adding or editing a location, you'll be able to manage all the same information as your main Business Profile.

## Display your locations

Each location will automatically have a page generated which displays a contact card for that location. A list of locations can also be found at the archive page, which will typically be at `your-domain.com/location`.

You can also add the Contact Card block to any page or post. Once added, click on the block and change the location in the options panel on the side.

You can also pass an additional `location` argument to the `[contact-card]` shortcode in any page or post. See all the [shortcode attributes](../faq#shortcode).

The Contact Card widget also includes a **Location** option. You can find this under **Appearance > Widgets**.

## Understanding the Schema.org relationship

The [Schema.org](http://schema.org) markup automatically assigns each location a `parentOrganization` attribute, which tells search engines like Google that this location is one branch of your overall business.

To ensure that Google understands your business properly, be sure to display the main Business Profile details somewhere on your site.

You may notice that the main Business Profile doesn't appear in the list of locations on the archive page. Leave this the way it is if your main profile points to a headquarters of some sort. But if it's a location just like your others, such as an original restaurant site for a restaurant with a few branches, you may want to create an extra location entry for this place.

## Customizing the display of your locations

You can customize how the locations are displayed by modifying template files. Learn more in the [developer documentation](../../developer).
