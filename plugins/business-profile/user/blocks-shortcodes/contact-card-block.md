The name of the Gutenberg block is **Contact Card**. It can be found in its own category/section called **Five Star Restaurant Business Profile and Schema**. Alternatively, when you add a new block, you can just search for **contact card** and add the block to the page.

After adding the block, you will see a preview of the contact card in the page edit area.

You will also see block parameters/options in the right sidebar that let you choose which location to use and specify which contact card elements you would like to include.
