Once the plugin is [installed and activated](install), go to the new **Business Profile** page in your WordPress admin area.

On this page you can enter your business name, contact information and opening hours. You'll also be asked to enter a few details you might not understand. The [FAQ](../faq) explains more details about the [Schema Type](../faq#schema-type) as well as the [Google Maps API Key](../faq/#google-maps-api-key).

## Display your contact card

Business Profile allows you to display these details on any page, post or sidebar.

- Add the Contact Card block to any page or post.
- Use the `[contact-card]` shortcode in any page or post. See all the [shortcode attributes](../faq#shortcode).
- Add the Contact Card widget in any sidebar. You'll find this under **Appearance > Widgets**.

When you use one of these techniques to display your business profile, it will be printed with [Schema.org](http://schema.org/) markup, which allows Google and other search engines to better interpret your business details.
