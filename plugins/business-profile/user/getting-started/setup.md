When you first activate the plugin, it will automatically run a walk-through that will help you add your business info, set opening hours, add your contact card to a page and create a schema rule.

The walk-through consists of four steps.

1. **Add a Contact Page**: This will create a new page on your WordPress site and place your contact card on it.

2. **Set Contact Information**: Here you can add your buisness information, which will display both in the contact card and as structured data on the page.

3. **Set Opening Hours**: Here you can set your opening hours, which will display both in the contact card and as structured data on the page.

4. **Create a Schema**: Here you can create a schema rule, to dynamically display structured data on your site. 

If you'd like, you can re-run the walk-through at any time by going to the following URL in your WordPress admin:

`admin.php?page=bpfwp-getting-started`

So, if, for example, your site domain is:

`https://www.my-site.com/`

Then, to restart the walk-through, you would go to: 

`https://www.my-site.com/admin.php?page=bpfwp-getting-started`

You're now ready to learn more about the [contact card](../contact-card) and about [schema](../schema).
