To add your contact card to a page, you can use either the included Gutenberg block or shortcode.

For the Gutenberg block, on the page edit screen, just click the + button to add a new block, search for **Contact Card** and add that block to the page.

[More information about the block](../blocks-shortcodes/contact-card-block).

You can also add the contact card to your page using the following shortcode:

`[contact-card]`

To use this shortcode on the page edit screen, just click the + button and add a new shortcode block to the page. Then write or paste in the above shortcode.

You can view more information and the available shortcode attributes [here](../blocks-shortcodes/contact-card-shortcode).

## Add Contact Card to Any Widget Area

This plugin also comes with a widget for displaying the contact card in a sidebar.

If you're not using a block theme, then you'll find it under the **Appearance > Widgets** page in your WordPress admin area. Simply add it to any widget area.

## Structured Data

When you use one of these methods to display your business profile, it will be printed with Schema.org structured data markup, which allows Google and other search engines to better interpret your business details and display them where appropriate in search/maps/etc. results.
