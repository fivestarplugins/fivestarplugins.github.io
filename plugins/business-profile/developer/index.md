The developer documentation is for coders who want to learn how to extend the plugin with customized templates, additional fields and more.

*If you're not a coder, you're probably looking for the [User Guide](../user).*

Business Profile is packed with hooks to make it extraordinarily extensible. It also outputs the contact card using a template, and features a number of template helper functions to help you output Schema.org-compliant markup in whatever form you'd like.

Learn more about [adding theme support](theme-support), [customizing templates](templates) and some of the many [filters](filters) that are available.
