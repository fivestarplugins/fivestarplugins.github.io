There are several ways you can show off your reviews on your website.

1. Every review gets it's own webpage. You can link to the review in your page or post content using the regular link tool in the post editor.

2. You can add a link to any single review or a category of reviews to your navigation menu, which you can set up under **Appearance > Menus**.

3. You can use the Good Reviews widget to add your reviews to any sidebar area, by going to **Appearance > Widgets**.

4. You can use the [shortcode](../faq#shortcode) to display one or more reviews in any page or post.
