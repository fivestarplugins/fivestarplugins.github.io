Once the plugin is [installed and activated](getting-started/install), go to the new **Reviews** page in your WordPress admin area.

To add a new review, click the **Add New** link at the top of the page. You'll see a familiar page where you can enter all of the review details.

Enter the reviewer's name at the top, where you'd normally put a post title.

I would encourage you to add a link to the review under **Review Link**, if it exists elsewhere on the web. This is good practice for SEO and makes the review seem more reliable.

The **Featured Image** should be used to add a profile image for the reviewer if you have one.

Once you've added a few reviews, you'll probably want to [display them on your site](display).
