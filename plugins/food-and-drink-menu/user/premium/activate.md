To activate the premium or ultimate versions, you need to download the **Five Star Plugins Premium Helper** plugin. You can do so by clicking the **Visit our website** link in the plugin dashboard.

Alternatively, you can download it directly [here](https://www.fivestarplugins.com/downloads/fsp-premium-helper.zip).

To install the helper plugin:

1. Go to the **Plugins** page in your WordPress admin area.
2. Click the **Add New** link at the top of the page, and then the **Upload Plugin** button on the next page.
3. Locate the plugin on your computer and select it.
4. Click **Install Now** and then activate the plugin.

Once the helper plugin is installed and activated, return to the {{ page.plugin_title }} dashboard where you will now see a field in which you can enter the product key you received.

## Premium

If you purchased a premium license, enter your key here and click the **Unlock Premium** button. This will instantly activate the premium version and give you access to all of its features.

If you happen to get a message saying the key was invalid, try entering it again, making sure to type it in manually, as, sometimes, copy/pasting it can bring in extra spaces, etc.

## Ultimate

If you purchased an ultimate license, the process is the same. Enter your key here and click the **Unlock** button. This will instantly activate the ultimate version and give you access to all of its features.

If you are currently using the premium version, then you will see the following text above the key field:

> Thanks for being a premium user! If you're looking to upgrade to our ultimate version, enter your new product key below.

However, if you are currently using the free version, then the enter key field will request that you unlock premium. Do not worry about this text. Entering your ultimate key will certainly unlock all ultimate features.

If you happen to get a message saying the key was invalid, try entering it again, making sure to type it in manually, as, sometimes, copy/pasting it can bring in extra spaces, etc.
