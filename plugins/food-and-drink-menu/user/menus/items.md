To create a menu item, go to the **Menu Items > Add Menu Item** page in your WordPress admin area. You'll see the following:

A Menu Item represents one dish from your menu. Use this page to give your Menu Item a title, like "Butternut Squash Soup", and a description, like "A creamy butternut squash soup made with a slice of toast on the side".

On the right, you'll see a number of panels for adding information to your Menu Item. Here you can enter in the price, add an image and assign each Menu Item to a Menu Section, such as Appetizers, Entrees and Desserts.

In the Menu Sections panel, type the name of the Menu Section you'd like to add this item to and click the **Add** button.

*Every Menu Item needs to be assigned to a Menu Section, or else you won't be able to add it to a menu.*

## Add More Items

Go ahead and create a couple more Menu Items following the steps above. For the next steps, you'll want at least a couple of Menu Sections, so make sure that two items are assigned to different sections.

Once you have created your desired items and sections, you're ready to now [create the menu](create-menu) to put them in.
