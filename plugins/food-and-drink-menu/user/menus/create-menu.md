To build a menu you will first create [menu items](items), assign them to sections and then add those to a menu using the instructions below.

Go to the **Menus > Add Menu** page in your WordPress admin area. You'll see the following page:

You'll recognize the title and description areas, which work just like your Menu Item. For now, let's focus on the **Menu Layout** panel.

You'll see your Menu Sections listed here. Now you can build a one- or two-column menu by adding the Menu Sections into your Menu.

Drag Menu Sections from the **Available Sections** column into any of the other columns to add them to your Menu. If you only want a single column, don't add any sections to the Second Column. The plugin will automatically discard the Second Column if no sections are assigned to it.

Once you click the **Publish** button at the top, your menu will be published. Now you're ready to [display your menu](add-menu-to-page).
