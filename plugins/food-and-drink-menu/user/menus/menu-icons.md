If you're using the [premium version](../premium) of the plugin, when creating or editing a menu item you'll see a panel for adding **Item Icons**. These icons can be used to designate information such as vegetarian dishes, organic produce, Halal or Kosher options and more.

The Menu Item Icons work just like the Tags you can assign to Posts in WordPress, with a twist. They can also have a visual icon associated with them.

To add an icon, go to the **Menus > Item Icons** page in your WordPress admin area. Here you can create a new entry by adding a name, slug description and choosing an icon. You can also edit an existing icon by clicking on it in the table on the right.

There's a wide range of icons you can use to signal dietary preferences, indicate healthy eating choices or cater to religious needs.

## Add icon flag to a menu item

To add an icon flag to a menu item, go to the **Menu Items** admin screen, click on the item you want to edit and find the **Item Icons** panel on the right. There you can choose which icon(s) you would like to assign to this item.

Once you've set up the icons and assigned them to a menu item, they'll display in your menu.

If there's no icon matching an Item Flag you'd like to use, it will fall back to a text display instead.

## Icon Font and Source Files

The premium version displays the icons as an icon font so that their color can be changed with CSS. Each icon is also provided as a vector file (SVG) so that graphic designers can make their own icons based on this set.
