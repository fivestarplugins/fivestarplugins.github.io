When you first activate the plugin, it will automatically run a walk-through that will help you create your menu items and add the menu to your site.

The walk-through consists of four steps.

1. **Create Sections**: This lets you create one or more sections, which you can then assign your menu items to. 

2. **Add Menu Items**: Here is where you create your menu items. You can choose an image, enter a name, description and answer, and assign each item to a section. You can create as many menu items as you want during the walk-through.

3. **Create a Menu**: Here you can create your menu and choose which sections to include in it. 

4. **Add a Menu Page**: This will create a new page on your WordPress site and place your menu on it.

If you'd like, you can re-run the walk-through at any time by going to the following URL in your WordPress admin:

`admin.php?page=fdm-getting-started`

So, if, for example, your site domain is:

`https://www.my-site.com/`

Then, to restart the walk-through, you would go to: 

`https://www.my-site.com/admin.php?page=fdm-getting-started`

You're now ready to learn more about [menus](../menus) and the available [blocks and shortcodes](../blocks-shortcodes).
