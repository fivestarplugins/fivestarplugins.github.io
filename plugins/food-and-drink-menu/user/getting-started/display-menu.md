Once you've [created a menu](create-menu), you can display it on your website in a variety of ways.

## Add your menu to any page or post

Add the menu block to any page or post on your site.

Blocks are also available for menu sections and menu items.

## Link to your menu from a navigation menu

Each Menu has it's own URL, and you can link to this directly from any navigation menu in your WordPress site.

To do this, go to the **Appearance > Menus** page in your WordPress admin area.

You'll see a new section of links you can add to the navigation menus specifically for your Food and Drink Menus. Add any Menu you've created from this page to link directly to it.

When you link to a Menu this way, it will use the same template as regular WordPress Posts. That's not appropriate in a lot of cases. If your theme includes a full-width page template, you'll probably want to use that so that your menu has enough room.

To use a different template, go to **Menus** and edit your menu. Look for the **Post Attributes** section on the side and change the Template. If you don't see the Post Attributes section or the Template option, that means your theme doesn't support any other templates.

## Add a menu to any widget area

This plugin also comes with widgets for displaying any Menu or Menu Item in a sidebar.

You'll find these under the **Appearance > Widgets** page in your WordPress admin area. Simply add them to any widget area and select the Menu or Menu Item you wish to display.
