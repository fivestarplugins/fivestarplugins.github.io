To build a menu you will first create **Menu Items**, assign them to **Menu Sections** and then add those to a **Menu**.

## <a name="create-menu-item"></a>Create a Menu Item

Go to the **Menu Items > Add Menu Item** page in your WordPress admin area. You'll see the following page:

A Menu Item represents one dish from your menu. Use this page to give your Menu Item a title, like "Butternut Squash Soup", and a description, like "A creamy butternut squash soup made with a slice of toast on the side".

## <a name="assign-item-to-section"></a>Assign the Menu Item to a Menu Section

On the right, you'll see a number of panels for adding information to your Menu Item. Here you can enter in the price, add an image and assign each Menu Item to a Menu Section, such as Appetizers, Entrees and Desserts.

In the Menu Sections panel, type the name of the Menu Section you'd like to add this item to and click the **Add** button.

*Every Menu Item needs to be assigned to a Menu Section, or else you won't be able to add it to a menu.*

## Add More Items

Go ahead and create a couple more Menu Items following the steps above. For the next steps, you'll want at least a couple of Menu Sections, so make sure that two items are assigned to different sections.

## <a name="create-menu"></a> Create a Menu

Go to the **Menus > Add Menu** page in your WordPress admin area. You'll see the following page:

You'll recognize the title and description areas, which work just like your Menu Item. For now, let's focus on the **Menu Layout** panel.

If you followed the steps above to [assign a menu item to a section](#assign-item-to-section), you'll see your Menu Sections listed here. Now you can build a one- or two-column menu by adding the Menu Sections into your Menu.

Drag Menu Sections from the **Available Sections** column into any of the other columns to add them to your Menu. If you only want a single column, don't add any sections to the Second Column. The plugin will automatically discard the Second Column if no sections are assigned to it.

Once you click the **Publish** button at the top, your menu will be published. Now you're ready to [display your menu](display-menu).
