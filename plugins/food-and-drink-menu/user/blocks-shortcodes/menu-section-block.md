The plugin comes with a Gutenberg block to display an individual menu section. The name of the block is **Menu Section**. It can be found in its own category/section called **Five Star Restaurant Menu**. Alternatively, when you add a new block, you can just search for **menu section** and add the block to the page.

After adding the block, you will see a preview of the menu section in the page edit area.

You will also see the following option in the right sidebar:

- **Select a Menu Section**: Lets you choose, from a dropdown, which menu section you would like to display.
