The plugin comes with a Gutenberg block to display an individual menu item. The name of the block is **Menu Item**. It can be found in its own category/section called **Five Star Restaurant Menu**. Alternatively, when you add a new block, you can just search for **menu item** and add the block to the page.

You will see the following option in the right sidebar:

- **Select a Menu Item**: Lets you choose, from a dropdown, which menu item you would like to display.
