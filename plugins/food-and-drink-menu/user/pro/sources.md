When you [create or edit a Menu Item](../getting-started/create-menu#create-menu-item) with the [Pro addon](../pro), you'll see a panel for adding information about the source of this item.

In addition to a **Source Name** and **Source Description**, you can add a **Source Address** which will display a Google map pinpointing the location of your supplier. Once an address has been supplied, a map will be displayed. You can use the **Map Zoom Level** option to change the map's level of detail.

This is great for showcasing the provenance of certain coffee blends or showing off your committment to local sourcing.

## When I add an address, the map doesn't appear.

Google now requires that you have your own API key to display a map on your website. Learn more about how to [set up your API key](google-map-api-key).
