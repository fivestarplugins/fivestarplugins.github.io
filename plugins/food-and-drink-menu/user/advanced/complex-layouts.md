title: Build menus with complex layouts

You may need a menu layout that is more complex than a one- or two-column layout. When these situations arise, you can use the block editor in WordPress to construct your own layout.

_The block editor is available for WordPress versions 5.0 and above._

If you can not use the block editor, you can [use grid shortcodes](https://www.fivestarplugins.com/2014/07/31/achieve-complex-menu-layouts-food-drink-menu/) to create complex layouts.

You can also learn more about [writing custom styles](https://www.fivestarplugins.com/2014/08/19/give-section-restaurant-menu-unique-style/) and even [modifying the code templates](https://www.fivestarplugins.com/2014/01/28/customize-restaurant-menu-templates/).
