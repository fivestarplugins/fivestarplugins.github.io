This section goes into greater detail about some of the plugin's features. You'll learn about tailoring your menu output with [shortcode attributes](shortcodes), what the [settings page](settings) offers you, and how to approach more [complex menu layouts](complex-layouts).

Are you looking to customize templates, add custom data or extend the plugin? You'll want to take a look at the [developer documentation](../../developer).

*Don't miss all the great features in the [Pro addon](../pro) too.*
