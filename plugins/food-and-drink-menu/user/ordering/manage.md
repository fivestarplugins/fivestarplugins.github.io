Go to the **Orders** page in your WordPress admin to see all of your orders.

At the top left you'll find quick filters to view all orders or only orders that have a specific status.

## Order Status

To change the status of an order, you can check the box beside it and then use the **Bulk actions** dropdown menu to set it to the status you would like. 

This works hand in hand with the **Maximum Received Orders** option, as an order needs to be assigned a status other than ***Received*** in order to be counted toward that maximum.

## Five Star Restaurant Manager Mobile App

You can also manage your orders directly in the [Five Star Restaurant Manager Mobile App](../fsrm). This way you can have your staff monitor new incoming orders on a tablet in the kitchen without them ever needing to log in to WordPress. And you can manage orders on the go from your phone! 

For more info about this, please see [here](../fsrm).
