You can turn on the ordering functionality using the **Enable Ordering** option found by going to **Settings > Ordering**.

If you would like to keep ordering enabled, but pause it for a period, you can temporarily close all ordering using the **Pause All Ordering** option. This will override all other settings and disable the ordering functionality on your menu. 

## Restricting Ordering

There are several options that let you restrict when the ordering functionality should be available on your site.

### Minimum Order

Use this to set a minimum amount (in dollars, euros, etc.) before an order can be sent? Leave blank for no minimum.

### Maximum Received Orders

Set a maximum number of orders that have been received and not assigned a new status (e.g. preparing, etc.) before ordering is stopped, to prevent being overwhelmed by a sudden surge in orders. Leave blank for no maximum to be applied.

### Schedule

Define the weekly schedule times during which you accept orders.

### Exceptions

Define special opening hours for holidays, events or other needs. Leave the time empty if you're closed all day.

## Further Options

There are also further options to set which fields should be required in the ordering checkout form and to set a number of days after which orders will be deleted, allowing you to abide by any laws or regulations that might exist for this in your region.

## Advanced Ordering Options

The following extra options are available to extend the ordering functionality:

### Enable Advanced Ordering Options

Allow ordering options (ex. lettuce, tomato, cheese, bacon for a burger or toppings for a pizza) as well as notes for individual items.

### Enable Order Progress Display

Display the status of a visitor's order on the menu page after they place an order. 

### Include Additional Prices

Enabling this will include any additional prices you have set for a menu item in the ordering functionality. Please be aware that, since the additional price fields are just text fields, into which you can input whatever combination of text/numbers/etc. that you want, you need to make sure you have formatted your additional prices to have only one number in them and in such a way that they will make sense for your ordering cart.
