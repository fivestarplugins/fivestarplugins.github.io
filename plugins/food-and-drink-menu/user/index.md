title: Food and Drink Menu User Guide
---
The user guide is for anyone who wants to learn how to [install the  plugin](getting-started/install), [create menus](getting-started/create-menu) and [display them on your WordPress website](getting-started/display-menu).

It covers more advanced features, such as [shortcode parameters](advanced/shortcodes), optional [settings](advanced/settings) and the many features of the plugin's [Pro addon](pro).

There's a [FAQ](faq) that answers many of the most common questions. And a [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/food-and-drink-menu) for the free plugin.

If you need help with the [Pro addon](pro), please use the [contact form](https://www.fivestarplugins.com/about/support) on my website.
