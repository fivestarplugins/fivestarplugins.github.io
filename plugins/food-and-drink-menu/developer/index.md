title: Five Star Restaurant Menu Developer Documentation
---
The developer documentation is for coders who want to learn how to extend the plugin with available filters, custom templates, plugin hooks and more.

*If you're not a coder, you're probably looking for the [User Guide](../user).*

<!-- Five Star Restaurant Reservations comes with several filters and hooks to make it more extensible for developers. -->
## Filters

The following filter is available. You could, for example, use this in your theme's functions.php file to extend the functionality of the plugin.

- `fdm_order_statuses` => This can be used to add your own custom order statuses. [Example](https://gist.github.com/fivestarplugins/6e5b8d81cf5d24ce542422344f523160).
