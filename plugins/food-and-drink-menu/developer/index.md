title: Five Star Restaurant Menu Developer Documentation (Archived)
---
The developer documentation is for coders who want to learn how to extend the plugin with custom templates, plugin hooks and more.

*If you're not a coder, you're probably looking for the [User Guide](../user).*

---

The developer documentation covers some old methods via which the plugin was modifiable by a developer. These are no longer supported and may no longer work as originally intended or at all. This section is left here for reference.
