title: Food and Drink Menu Developer Documentation
---
The developer documentation is for coders who want to learn how to extend the plugin with custom templates, plugin hooks and more.

*If you're not a coder, you're probably looking for the [User Guide](../user).*

---

The developer documentation is not complete. When it is, it will be a handy reference for every hook, as well as the place to find best practices for extending the plugin to ensure future compatibility.

Until then, I'll list are a bunch of resources you may find useful. If you've got a question, post on the [support forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/food-and-drink-menu) or the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NateWr/food-and-drink-menu).

*Sign up for my [mailing list](https://www.fivestarplugins.com/about/mailing-list) to be notified when this documentation is complete.*
